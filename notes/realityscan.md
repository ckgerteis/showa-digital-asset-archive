# RealityScan

We are using RealityScan to build our library of digital objects.

RealityScan is a free 3D scanning app that turns smartphone photos into high-fidelity 3D models. It integrates with modern engines and supports typical photogrammetry workflows.

Training resources and product pages can be linked from the README as needed. For now, users should follow RealityScan guidance on capture density, overlap, and lighting to produce publishable assets.
