**Preserving the Material Heritage of Modern Japan**

We are building a library of 3D digitized objects used in everyday life during the Showa Era (1926-1989).

We think 3D digitization offers an ideal means to create an interactive virtual record of the material artefacts that distinguished everyday life in modern Japan.

We invite specialists of all kinds involved in preserving cultural patrimony to join us in ensuring that Japan's twentieth-century cultural heritage does not disappear.

## Mission and argument
This project treats three interlocking claims as practical imperatives. First, ordinary objects, kitchenware, furniture, signage, industrial tools, and industrial artifacts: they register social practices and index broad shifts in daily life over time. Second, immersive technologies and 3D modeling, by excavating subtle textures and material states, counterpose nuanced records of cultural pasts against generalized national nostalgia. Third, as virtual reconstructions become ubiquitous in contemporary pedagogy and historical world-building, their affective and narrative force depends on credible assets.
