# The Showa Digital Asset Archive
**15 December 2025**

**Preserving the Material Heritage of Modern Japan**

We are building a library of 3D digitized objects used in everyday life during the Showa Era (1926-1989).

We think 3D digitization offers an ideal means to create an interactive virtual record of the material artefacts that distinguished everyday life in modern Japan.

We invite specialists of all kinds involved in preserving cultural patrimony to join us in ensuring that Japan's twentieth-century cultural heritage does not disappear.

## Mission and argument

This project treats three interlocking claims as practical imperatives. First, ordinary objects, kitchenware, furniture, signage, industrial tools, and industrial artifacts: they register social practice, material constraint, and the infrastructures of everyday life. Second, those objects are fragile in the digital and material senses: market turnover, platform changes, and simple decay produce discontinuities in what can be studied or shown. Third, three-dimensional digitization gives us a way to represent form, scale, and surface in a way that still images and text cannot; when combined with careful provenance notes and licensing metadata, 3D records can serve both scholarship and XR production. These claims orient the archive toward a link-forward, annotation-rich model rather than a repository of redistributed binaries.

## Scope and cautions

We define the Showa Era as the cultural and political period conventionally associated with the monumental changes in Japan from 1926 to 1989, which coincided with the prewar, wartime, and postwar reign of the Showa Emperor. 
For practical tagging, we use five pragmatic slices that foreground changing urban infrastructures, domestic technologies, and consumption regimes. Dates and period tags are hypotheses about usage and feel, not certificates of provenance. The archive records license type and provenance; users must verify each listing before reuse, and branded items require careful permissioning.

## How to use

- Browse the catalog in `catalog/fab.yml` and consult `catalog/vocab.yml` for controlled tags.  
- Add candidates via Issues or pull requests using `templates/new-entry.md`.  
- Keep this repository link-first: include Fab or Sketchfab listing URLs and short provenance notes rather than hosting binaries.  
- For procurement or private sharing create a companion private register rather than committing binaries to this public finding aid.

## Licensing

This repository documents licenses stated on external listings (commonly Fab Standard or CC BY). The repository itself is released under the MIT License. Always confirm the license terms on the asset page before reuse.

## Call to specialists

We welcome curators, conservators, museum technologists, archivists, and XR practitioners. Contribute assets, improve historical notes, or join the technical audit of formats and polycounts. The archiveâ€™s usefulness depends on disciplined provenance work and collective attention to periodization.
