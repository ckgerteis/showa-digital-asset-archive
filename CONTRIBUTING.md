# Contributing

This project is a link archive and metadata register.

## What to submit

- A URL to a 3D artifact available on a service such as Fab/Sketchfab or 
- A short statement of historical fit (and what might be anachronistic)
- Any XR performance notes (scale, LOD, texture sizes, formats)
- The license type as stated on the listing (Standard or CC-BY)

## What not to submit

- Binaries copied from any commercial or non-commercial listings. This is not an archive for binaries.
- Derived redistributable packages meant to substitute for the listing. This is a curated database for historically accurate, useful 3D artefacts for game building or heritage reconstruction.
