                        <p class="lead">We are building a library of 3D digitized objects used in everyday life during the Showa Era (1926-1989).</p>
                        <p>We think 3D digitization offers an ideal means to create an interactive virtual record of the material artefacts that distinguished everyday life in modern Japan. We invite specialists of all kinds involved in preserving cultural patrimony to join us in ensuring that Japan's twentieth-century cultural heritage does not disappear.</p>

                            <p><strong>1. Social Indexing:</strong> First, ordinary objects—kitchenware, furniture, signage, industrial tools, and industrial artifacts—register social practices and index broad shifts in daily life over time.</p>
                            <p><strong>2. Countering Nostalgia:</strong> Second, immersive technologies and 3D modeling, by excavating subtle textures and material states, counterpose nuanced records of cultural pasts against generalized national nostalgia.</p>
                            <p><strong>3. Credible Narratives:</strong> Third, as virtual reconstructions become ubiquitous in contemporary pedagogy and historical world-building, their affective and narrative force depends on credible assets.</p>

                            <p>An international academic effort spearheaded by historian Christopher Gerteis, this project focuses on 3D digitization of everyday objects from the Showa era. The team is building a library of high-fidelity 3D models of material culture used in Japanese daily life between 1925 and 1989. Using techniques like laser scanning and photogrammetry (even Apple's LiDAR "RealityScan" for quick captures), they have begun preserving artifacts ranging from household appliances and electronics to toys and personal items of the era. By scanning these objects and hosting them on platforms like Sketchfab, the project not only safeguards their form and appearance but also makes them accessible globally for study and virtual exhibition. This is especially relevant for sites like Hashima Island (Gunkanjima) – a famous abandoned mining town from the Showa industrial boom – where researchers can preserve artifacts and architecture from an otherwise decaying environment.</p>

Both Japanese and international projects converge on key goals: preserving the memory of the Showa era's events, architecture, and daily life through immersive technology. Crucially, many are supported by public institutions or universities, indicating a broad recognition of the value of digitally safeguarding Showa history.</p>

                            <p>A critically acclaimed action-adventure game set in 1988, during the late Showa years at the height of Japan's "bubble economy." Yakuza 0 painstakingly recreates fictionalized Tokyo and Osaka districts based on real locations as they looked in the 80s. Neon-lit streets are filled with period-accurate shop signs, arcades, VHS rental stores, and fashion, immersing the player in the hustle of the boom era. The game has been praised as "an incredibly honest and faithful representation of Showa-era Japan" – depicting a society of gaudy excess where money flows freely and new glass high-rises begin to tower over old ramen shops. The narrative uses this setting not just as window dressing but as plot fuel: the story centers on a real estate scramble, with criminal factions fighting over property during the Showa-era real estate bubble.</p>

                            <p>Often regarded as a pioneer of open-world design, Shenmue is set in 1986 Yokosuka, a port city in Japan. Players explore a faithfully modeled Japanese town in the Showa 60 era, complete with a neighborhood candy shop, gacha toy machines, vintage Sega arcade games, and neighbors who follow daily routines. The game is "part revenge epic, part Japanese life simulator." Shenmue's attention to mundane details (drinking soda from a vending machine, feeding a stray cat, waiting for the bus) effectively captures late-Showa everyday life. The living world around the protagonist – grounded firmly in Showa aesthetics – is what made Shenmue a cultural touchstone.</p>

                            <p>"My Summer Vacation" is a series of Japanese games that drop the player into the role of a young boy visiting relatives in the Japanese countryside in August 1975 (Showa 50). These games have no combat or grand conflict; instead, they simulate the nostalgic pleasures of a Showa-era childhood summer – catching cicadas, playing with water rockets, listening to evening cicada cries and distant wind chimes. The hand-drawn backgrounds depict wooden traditional homes, rolling green hills, and analog details like manga magazines and black-and-white TV sets that firmly root the experience in the 1970s. This series is a prime example of using digital media to evoke collective nostalgia, inviting players to yearn for the "simple life" of Showa days.</p>

                            <h5><strong>VRChat Worlds – User-Created Showa Environments</strong></h5>
                            <p>In the social VR platform VRChat, creators (both Japanese and international) have built numerous explorable worlds that pay homage to Showa-era settings. Examples include "Retro Kofu Night Walk" – a virtual replica of a Japanese street from the Showa period with old signage and narrow alleys – and 「昭和の古いアパート」 ("Old Showa-era Apartment"), which lets visitors wander through a rundown 1970s apartment block with tatami-matted rooms and vintage calendars. During <a href="https://www.v-market.work/" target="_blank">Virtual Market 2021</a>, the Japanese clothing brand BEAMS collaborated on a "Virtual Showa Asakusa" environment (promoting Netflix's <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81317135" target="_blank"><em>Asakusa Kid</em></a>) featuring a virtual izakaya bar and theater where avatars could perform Showa-style tap dance routines. Such VRChat experiences blend entertainment and exhibition – users not only see period-accurate buildings and objects, but can socialize within them.</p>

                            <p>An upcoming action-RPG that takes Showa nostalgia in a wild new direction. Developed by a Chinese studio, this game is set in an alternate 1980s where Japan's Showa-era culture has come to dominate a post-apocalyptic United States. The premise mixes zombie B-movie mayhem with distinctly Showa flavors: players control a teenage girl traveling across an 80s America full of neon-lit arcades, city pop music, and martial-arts movie tropes. Billed as "an enthusiastic love letter to the '80s pop culture," Showa American Story exemplifies how the Showa era is now exported and reimagined in international entertainment.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p class="mt-5">From big-budget console games to fan-made VR chatrooms, the Showa era provides a rich palette of settings. English-language coverage of these games often praises the authenticity and educational value of the settings, while Japanese discussions emphasize the <em>natsukashii</em> (nostalgic) feelings these digital worlds elicit. The careful construction of Showa-era environments – whether realistic or fantastical – significantly enriches the user experience, allowing entertainment products to double as cultural time capsules.</p>

                        <h3 class="mb-4">Digital Strategies and Thematic Narratives</h3>
                        <p>Across both heritage and entertainment platforms, the Showa era is brought to life through two main digital strategies: the creation of detailed 3D environments (macro-scale recreations of places) and the preservation of authentic objects or artifacts (micro-scale details). These digital assets serve as stages and props for narratives that reflect the complex history of the Showa period.</p>
                        
                        <h5 class="mt-4"><strong>3D Scanning and Photogrammetry of Artifacts</strong></h5>
                        <p>Many projects put special focus on digital objects from the Showa era. The Hashima XR Project's artifact library scans everyday items like Showa-era televisions, telephones, cameras, and other household goods into 3D models. Once digitized, these objects can be examined in virtual galleries or inserted into larger simulations. By preserving such objects, creators ensure that the textures of Showa life – the look of a 10-yen ramune bottle or the sound of a rotary phone – can be experienced by those who never lived through it.</p>
                        
                        <h5 class="mt-4"><strong>Reconstructed Virtual Environments</strong></h5>
                        <p>Whether it's an entire city district like 1940s Ginza or a humble 1960s apartment, reconstructing environments is key to situating users in Showa contexts. These environments are often created through archival research plus modern 3D modeling. The narrative impact of these environments is significant – a reconstructed environment provides context and mood that can amplify a story's themes, from the horror of war in Hiroshima VR to the nostalgic simplicity in Boku no Natsuyasumi's peaceful village.</p>
                        
                        <h5 class="mt-4"><strong>Key Themes in Digital Showa Representations</strong></h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Nostalgia for Everyday Life:</strong> Many projects evoke nostalgia for family, community, and the perceived "simpler times" of mid-20th-century Japan, with warm lighting, retro color palettes, and slice-of-life narrative vignettes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Trauma and War Memory:</strong> Heritage digital projects tackle the trauma of Showa history – WWII, nuclear bombings, and postwar occupation – using immersive tech to foster empathy and pass down lessons of history.</li>
                            <li><strong>Modernity and Rapid Change:</strong> Many representations emphasize the era's breakneck modernization, with themes of "old vs new" visible in cityscapes where skyscrapers rise next to traditional shophouses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Family and Social Structure:</strong> Digital narratives often focus on the multi-generational family, strong neighborhood communities, and the transition to nuclear families during the postwar boom.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                            <p>From virtual museums preserving fading memories to video games resurrecting the sights and sounds of mid-20th-century Japan, the Showa era lives on vibrantly in digital form. Japanese-led projects have leveraged 3D scanning, VR, and AR to safeguard cultural heritage – enabling anyone, anywhere to tour a Showa-era home or city street. At the same time, game developers and online communities worldwide have embraced Showa Japan as an evocative setting.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">Heritage projects lend factual depth and gravitas – ensuring virtual Showa worlds are credible and respectful of history. Entertainment projects contribute creative breadth, introducing the era to new audiences under the guise of play or storytelling. Together they form a multifaceted digital remembrance of Showa. In an age when the last generation with direct Showa memories is aging, these digital reconstructions and narratives will play an ever more important role in how the world recalls Japan's dramatic 20th century.</p>
