                        <p class="lead">We are building a library of 3D digitized objects used in everyday life during the Showa Era (1926-1989).</p>
                        <p>We think 3D digitization offers an ideal means to create an interactive virtual record of the material artifacts that distinguished everyday life in modern Japan. We invite specialists of all kinds involved in preserving cultural patrimony to join us in ensuring that Japan's twentieth-century cultural heritage does not disappear.</p>

                        <p>This project treats three interlocking claims as practical imperatives:</p>
                        <div class="mission-quote">
                            <p><strong>1. Social Indexing:</strong> First, ordinary objects (kitchenware, furniture, signage, industrial tools, and industrial artifacts) register social practices and index broad shifts in daily life over time.</p>
                            <p><strong>2. Countering Nostalgia:</strong> Second, immersive technologies and 3D modeling, by excavating subtle textures and material states, counterpose nuanced records of cultural pasts against generalized national nostalgia.</p>
                            <p><strong>3. Credible Narratives:</strong> Third, as virtual reconstructions become ubiquitous in contemporary pedagogy and historical world-building, their affective and narrative force depends on credible assets.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-4">Teaching Material Culture Digitally</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Material culture is not “background” to history. It is a primary archive of practice: how bodies moved, what infrastructures demanded, what kinds of labor were assumed, and how designs stabilized (or disrupted) social expectations in everyday life.</p>

                        <p>In a digital archive, 3D surrogates function as primary sources that can be handled without damage. The point is not only realism. It is method. Students can isolate components, compare variants, measure proportion, and argue from wear, assembly, and ergonomics in ways that a still photograph rarely permits.</p>

                        <hr class="my-4">

                        <h3 class="mb-3">Why 3D?</h3>

                        <div class="pedagogy-step">
                            <h5>1. Scale, posture, and the built environment</h5>
                            <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Domestic space is a technology of the body. Floor-sitting, storage patterns, thresholds, and circulation routes index lived constraints and social norms.</p>
                            <p><strong>Application:</strong> Start from a spatial component rather than an “iconic object.” Use a tatami-room interior as a measuring device for postwar domestic life: students can infer circulation paths, storage logics, and the relationship between furniture height and posture by working inside a modeled room rather than looking at it from outside. Pair a room model with a standardized tatami unit to make the argument legible as proportion and habit, not atmosphere.</p>

                            <h5>2. Design history, materials, and industrial time</h5>
                            <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Showa design history is not a simple story of “traditional to modern.” It is an uneven overlay of craft, mass production, corporate branding, and export logics that reorganized domestic life and taste.</p>
                            <p><strong>Application:</strong> Ask students to compare a storage cabinet associated with long-lived carpentry practices to an industrially standardized, globally circulating consumer object. Treat the comparison as an argument about materials, production, and social circulation: what kinds of labor become visible or invisible, what kinds of maintenance are expected, what kind of space each object presumes, and how branding changes the object’s social life.</p>

                            <h5>3. Infrastructures of work, risk, and repair</h5>
                            <p><strong>Concept:</strong> “Everyday life” includes industrial time, workplace risk, and the designed management of safety. Objects of work are often the clearest index of how institutions governed bodies and extracted labor.</p>
                            <p><strong>Application:</strong> Use a safety artifact as a gateway to discuss labor regimes rather than treating it as a prop. Students can write object biographies that include manufacture, institutional adoption, maintenance, and the politics of risk. The point is to connect form to governance: what the object assumes about accidents, accountability, and worker visibility.</p>

                            <p>We recommend adapting Jules Prown’s descriptive sequence, with an added design-and-ethics step appropriate to 3D assets:</p>
                            <ol class="mb-0">
                                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Description:</strong> What is observable (materials, joins, geometry, wear, scale cues). Require claims to be anchored in visible evidence.</li>
                                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Deduction:</strong> What kinds of bodily movement does the object demand or discourage (posture, grip, reach, maintenance).</li>
                                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Contextualization:</strong> Where does the object sit in Showa time (policy, infrastructure, household economy, labor regime, consumption).</li>
                                <li class="mb-0"><strong>Design-and-ethics check:</strong> If you deploy this asset in a game, VR exhibit, or heritage simulation, what claims are you making, what are you erasing, and what responsibilities follow from that use.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p class="mt-3 mb-0">For more examples, encourage students to browse the <a href="catalog.html">Catalog</a>, then propose additions or variants (the archive grows through comparative sets, not single “representative” objects).</p>

This VR experience reconstructs a 1962 middle-class apartment (<em>danchi</em>) unit, fully furnished with period-appropriate appliances and décor. It portrays the life of a family headed by a Tokyo commuter in the early 1960s, complete with the "latest conveniences" of the time. Through photogrammetry and 3D modeling, visitors can immerse themselves in the layout and objects of a typical Showa-era household, illustrating how Japan's postwar modernity entered everyday domestic life.</p>

Developers are using thousands of found photographs from the 1954–1974 period to build a 3D cityscape of 1964 Tokyo. Participants (including major partners like NHK and Sony) contribute images and memories, which are then stitched into a VR urban diorama. The goal is to create a "time machine" experience where users can walk through Tokyo's Showa-era streets, recognizing landmarks like newly built highways and Olympic venues.</p>

Based on detailed historical research using maps, photographs, and documents, the Ginza VR lets users "time-travel" to a bustling Ginza street corner in 1940, seeing period-accurate buildings, transportation (streetcars, early automobiles), signage, and even fashions on virtual pedestrians. The online experience launched in 2021, allowing global audiences to explore Ginza's transformation.</p>

                            <p>An international academic effort spearheaded by historian Christopher Gerteis, this project focuses on 3D digitization of everyday objects from the Showa era. The team is building a library of high-fidelity 3D models of material culture used in Japanese daily life between 1925 and 1989. Using techniques like laser scanning and photogrammetry (including Apple's LiDAR “RealityScan” for quick captures), they have begun preserving artifacts ranging from household appliances and electronics to toys and personal items of the era. By scanning these objects and hosting them on platforms like Sketchfab, the project not only safeguards their form and appearance but also makes them accessible globally for study and virtual exhibition. This is especially relevant for sites like Hashima Island (Gunkanjima) – a famous abandoned mining town from the Showa industrial boom – where researchers can preserve artifacts and architecture from an otherwise decaying environment.</p>

                        <p class="mt-5">Together, these examples illustrate a range of heritage approaches: from virtual museums and city "time machines" to photogrammetric archives. Both Japanese and international projects converge on key goals: preserving the memory of the Showa era's events, architecture, and daily life through immersive technology. Crucially, many are supported by public institutions or universities, indicating a broad recognition of the value of digitally safeguarding Showa history.</p>

                        <p>Beyond the museum sphere, the Showa era has become a rich backdrop for commercial games and user-generated virtual environments. Developers and creators often tap into Showa-period settings to provide players with worlds that feel authentic or nostalgically familiar:</p>

                            <h5><strong><a href="https://ryu-ga-gotoku.com/zero-directorscut/" target="_blank">Yakuza 0</a> (Sega, 2015)</strong></h5>
                            <p>A critically acclaimed action-adventure game set in 1988, during the late Showa years at the height of Japan's "bubble economy." Yakuza 0 painstakingly recreates fictionalized Tokyo and Osaka districts based on real locations as they looked in the 80s. Neon-lit streets are filled with period-accurate shop signs, arcades, VHS rental stores, and fashion, immersing the player in the hustle of the boom era. The narrative uses this setting not just as window dressing but as plot fuel: the story centers on a real estate scramble, with criminal factions fighting over property during the Showa-era real estate bubble.</p>

                            <p>Often regarded as a pioneer of open-world design, Shenmue is set in 1986 Yokosuka, a port city in Japan. Players explore a faithfully modeled Japanese town in the Showa 60 era, complete with a neighborhood candy shop, gacha toy machines, vintage Sega arcade games, and neighbors who follow daily routines. Shenmue's attention to mundane details (drinking soda from a vending machine, feeding a stray cat, waiting for the bus) effectively captures late-Showa everyday life.</p>

                            <p>In the social VR platform VRChat, creators (both Japanese and international) have built numerous explorable worlds that pay homage to Showa-era settings. During <a href="https://www.v-market.work/" target="_blank">Virtual Market 2021</a>, the Japanese clothing brand BEAMS collaborated on a "Virtual Showa Asakusa" environment (promoting Netflix's <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81317135" target="_blank"><em>Asakusa Kid</em></a>) featuring a virtual izakaya bar and theater where avatars could perform Showa-style tap dance routines. The same retro-urban imaginary circulates through adjacent streaming nostalgia, including Netflix’s <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80113037" target="_blank"><em>Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories</em></a>.</p>

We note it here primarily as a market-facing example of how Showa visual culture and material signs can be lifted as an aesthetic kit for violent spectacle, rather than handled as historically accountable heritage. In that sense, it helps clarify what this Archive is not trying to do, even as it shows one commercial path that developers may pursue when Showa-era assets become widely available.</p>

                        <h3 class="mb-4">Digital Strategies and Thematic Narratives</h3>
                        <p>Across both heritage and entertainment platforms, the Showa era is brought to life through two main digital strategies: the creation of detailed 3D environments (macro-scale recreations of places) and the preservation of authentic objects or artifacts (micro-scale details). These digital assets serve as stages and props for narratives that reflect the complex history of the Showa period.</p>

                        <h5 class="mt-4"><strong>3D Scanning and Photogrammetry of Artifacts</strong></h5>
                        <p>Many projects put special focus on digital objects from the Showa era. Once digitized, these objects can be examined in virtual galleries or inserted into larger simulations. By preserving such objects, creators ensure that the textures of Showa life can be experienced by those who never lived through it.</p>

                        <h5 class="mt-4"><strong>Reconstructed Virtual Environments</strong></h5>
                        <p>Whether it's an entire city district like 1940s Ginza or a humble 1960s apartment, reconstructing environments is key to situating users in Showa contexts. These environments are often created through archival research plus modern 3D modeling.</p>

                        <h5 class="mt-4"><strong>Key Themes in Digital Showa Representations</strong></h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Nostalgia for Everyday Life:</strong> Many projects evoke nostalgia for family, community, and the perceived "simpler times" of mid-20th-century Japan.</li>
                            <li><strong>Trauma and War Memory:</strong> Heritage digital projects tackle the trauma of Showa history using immersive tech to foster empathy and pass down lessons of history.</li>
                            <li><strong>Modernity and Rapid Change:</strong> Many representations emphasize the era's breakneck modernization, with themes of "old vs new" visible in cityscapes where skyscrapers rise next to traditional shophouses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Family and Social Structure:</strong> Digital narratives often focus on the multi-generational family, neighborhood communities, and the transition to nuclear families during the postwar boom.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                            <p>From virtual museums preserving fading memories to video games resurrecting the sights and sounds of mid-20th-century Japan, the Showa era lives on vibrantly in digital form. Heritage projects lend factual depth and gravitas, ensuring virtual Showa worlds are credible and historically responsible, while entertainment projects contribute creative breadth and reach.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">Together they form a multifaceted digital remembrance of Showa. In an age when the last generation with direct Showa memories is aging, these digital reconstructions and narratives will play an ever more important role in how the world recalls Japan's dramatic twentieth century.</p>

                        <h5 class="mt-4">1. Preferred Formats</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>glTF / GLB:</strong> Preferred for web-readiness and PBR materials.</li>
                            <li><strong>OBJ / FBX:</strong> Accepted for archival geometry, provided textures are included.</li>

                        <p class="lead">
                            These modular lesson plans treat digital 3D assets as primary sources. The point is not simply to “decorate” a scene, but to practice historically grounded interpretation through material culture: students make explicit, testable claims about time, place, labor, and everyday life by attending to scale, wear, repair, interfaces, packaging, and spatial arrangement.

                                <li><strong>For humanities students:</strong> the exercise trains close reading of objects as evidence. Everyday things condense policy, industry, gendered labor, and built environments, especially in the high-growth decades when domestic life was reorganized through consumer durables and new media ecologies.</li>
                                <li><strong>For design students:</strong> the exercise connects form to constraint. Students learn to explain why a given interface, footprint, material, or maintenance pattern makes sense (or does not) within a historically specific household, budget, and infrastructure.</li>
                                <li><strong>For both:</strong> the goal is to move from “plausible vibes” to <em>argued plausibility</em>: what in the object makes your period/location claim credible, and what evidence would falsify it.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>This module links everyday prosperity to industrial work and extraction. Students use mining-related assets to think about what is made visible or invisible in “modernization” narratives, and how labor, safety, and environment are represented.</p>

                            <p><strong>Core question:</strong> What must be true about labor and risk for this vision of “growth” to function?</p>

                                            “High growth” is often narrated as macroeconomics, but for students working with 3D assets it is more productive to treat it as a reorganization of everyday infrastructures and routines. Domestic electrification, mass distribution, and the normalization of repair and replacement created new expectations about comfort, hygiene, storage, and media time. A television console or refrigerator, read closely, is an argument about space and household management: where cords can run, where heat can vent, how cleaning is imagined, and which tasks are assumed to be repetitive rather than exceptional. The point is not to claim that any one object “represents” the period. Rather, students should learn to link observable features to a bounded claim about when and where such an object becomes plausible, and what it presumes about household budgets, service networks, and the social organization of labor in the home.
                                        </p>

                                            Teaching tip: Require students to name what the object cannot tell them on its own (purchase price, brand status, region), then assign a “minimal corroboration” task (an advertisement, a household budget table, a housing plan) as follow-up evidence.

                                            Postwar housing is a crucial hinge for material-culture work because it sets the constraints that make objects “fit” or “misfit.” The spread of apartment living (including danchi) and the persistence of mixed interiors complicate simplistic narratives of tradition versus modernity. Students should treat room components (tatami modules, thresholds, storage walls, circulation) as technologies that discipline bodies and organize privacy. Even small placement decisions can be turned into arguments: a kotatsu implies a winter social geography, a phone implies a household boundary and an institutional network, a wall clock implies a regime of scheduled time. The analytical payoff comes when students connect these spatial logics to family structure, gendered labor, and neighborhood governance, rather than stopping at “nostalgic atmosphere.”

                                            Teaching tip: Assign a “one-room proof” exercise. Students must justify every placement in writing and identify one non-negotiable constraint (cords, cleaning, sleep storage, guest etiquette) that forces trade-offs.

                                            Telephony, school goods, and routine institutional artifacts are not neutral. They materialize access, enforce schedules, and rehearse hierarchies through placement and use. Instructors can frame a phone not as “retro tech,” but as an object that implies subscription systems, repair infrastructures, household authority, and the spatial politics of privacy (who answers, where it rings, what can be overheard). In the classroom, the strongest student work connects institutional time to domestic time: the bell schedule, shift work, commuting, children’s homework, and the shared spaces where these regimes collide.

                                            A digital archive of Showa objects risks reproducing a familiar split: the warm domestic interior versus the distant industrial exterior. This module refuses that split by treating energy and labor as everyday conditions. Mining assets, safety equipment, and industrial scenes should be used to make representation itself a question. What becomes visible (machines, tunnels, buildings) and what remains absent (bodies, dust, sound, injury, governance) is not an accident. Students should learn to name what the model cannot show, and to write historically responsible captions that resist turning extraction into “scenery.” The goal is not to moralize, but to connect consumption to systems, and to identify the narrative shortcuts that entertainment media often takes.
